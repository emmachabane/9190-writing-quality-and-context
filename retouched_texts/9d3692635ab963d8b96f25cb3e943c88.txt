Tonight was my night. Tonight I was reading. There is a certain feeling that
comes with getting up in front of the masses of strangers. It’s the tightening of
your lungs, making it harder to breathe. It’s the sweat that pours from your
pores then chills to make you feel something other than scared; discomfort. That
discomfort keeps you moving, keeps the words flowing. It’s speaking without
knowing, whether you’ll make it to the end, for fear that someone will pull out a
gun and shoot, killing you and your creativity, metaphorically. Luckily, I live in a
bullet proof vest. It’s the applause, o the booing, both are just as the other to me.
With clapping comes praise, but also lies. Groupthink is a real son-of-a-bitch.
While the few boos that weakly resonate within the applause are the honest
disapproval. That’s what I listen for. Honest disapproval. Makes me know that
I’m doing something right. I round the corner of 5th and Maple, entering the
convenience store for more cigarettes.
Inside was empty. The store clerk was either in the back or not in. I walked
up to the counter and rang the service bell, once. A few moments passed, I rang it
again. Still no one. I turned and walked over to the snacks aisle. I picked up a
pack of trial mix on sale and read the label. “A mixture of high energy, all natural
ingredients to keep you fueled up and going! Ingredients: Peanuts, Cashews,
Almonds, Cranberries, Raisins, and M&M’s.” I put the packet back on the shelf.
To my left there is an ice box. A “ON SALE” sign hangs above the beer section of

the box. I open it and grab a six pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon, “Originally $5.99, now
only &4.99,” and go back to the counter. Still no clerk in sight. I ring the bell, this
time with much more frustration released in my tiny slaps to the chime. A teen
runs out from the back room, hands wildly attempting to button the buttons on
his shirt, belt still undone.

!
“Hi...uh...ho...how can I help you?”

“I’m in need of service so I can get the hell out of here. Some of us have
things to do, damn it!”

!
“Of course, sir!” the kid took a large gulp, “What can I do for you?”

!
“This and a pack of Spirits, menthol.” He hastily reached up and grabbed
the cigarettes, then rang me up fast as if he were trying to make up for lost time.
What he may not realize is, time can’t be made up. Once it’s lost, it’s lost.”

!
“$12.31,” he tells me.

!
“What, no discount for killing my time?”

!

The kid just stares at me, not knowing how to respond. I hand him my last
twenty and get the change. Seven dollars and sixty-nine cents. I slide it in my
pocket and look up at the kid.

!
“Look, kid.” I say to him, “I know what you’re doing back there.”

!
The kids relaxed expression falls from his face. He is frozen, turned
towards me, unsure how to respond.

!
“You’re back there disposing of the shop owners body.”

!
“Excuse me!” the kid cried out.

!
“Wait until I phone the police about this.”

!
“That’s not what I was doing, sir! I swear!” A young blonde with a decent
face, but large bust walks out from the back. I turned away from the both of them
and headed for the door.

!
“I swear, sir! We were just...” I cut the kid off.

!
“Listen, if you really swear over something, you wouldn’t jinx it by
swearing. That’s how I know you’re lying. I hope, for your sake, you don’t drop

the soap in prison. A good-looking guy like yourself will make a tasty treat for
some butt-fucking inmate once the police hear about this. I swear they will.” I
turned and left. As I exited the store I could hear the kid begin to weep and the
faint words, “What a fucking asshole,” leak from the blondes ruby lips.
As I continued down the walkway, passing a closed down barbershop, I
crack a beer and begin to think. That’ll teach him to fuck on my time, I reassure
myself. The world is a shitty, cruel place, and someone had to show him just how
horrible people can be. Had he killed the insane man’s time, he’d be dead. My
sanity spared his sad soul. He’ll realize when he calms down that it was all just a
rouse. Nothing more than an awfully hidden lie. Either way, kid had it coming,
and kid will get over it. Especially like a woman like that at his side. I take a gulp
of the beer as I walk, feeling victorious.

Three cigarettes and four beers later, I’m almost at the location of the
reading. It is placed in a more pleasant part of town. I’m not fond of it. The
upscale, classy nature of this area. It is just a breeding ground for people who like
to think they’re better than everyone else, when really, no one person is better
than the other, or worse for that matter. We’re all capable of the same things
when we’re pushed in just the right direction.
I’m two buildings down from the spot when I pass a local bookstore. I
usually never stop to look in the window. There never seems to be anything worth

reading. For some reason, tonight I was compelled to do just that though. I pause
in front of the large bay window, and turn towards it. Just as I suspected, there is
not one author worth reading in the window. Just a bunch of new age gimmicks
and contemporary sex stories. These were the Hemingway's, the Huxley's, the
Vonnegut’s, the Hansum’s of our time, and it made me sick to my gut. I continued
to scan the books desperately for something worth while, some sort of salvage to
our cultural downfall. That’s when I saw it. One decent author had made the cut.
“Broken Petals, Fluttering Wings,” by Rachel Le’Oré. She had made the cut. I
stood staring at her book, wondering what the contents of this one may contain.
Her last book was all poetry. It wasn’t filled with any pain, any struggle, but only
the beauty of the world that we tend to forget about. That was why I enjoyed it. It
was an escape from my monotonous lifestyle of up and downs, with the one
singular outcome. I checked my watch. The time was 7:43pm and the reading was
in one hour and seventeen minutes. I took one more look at the book then walked
away from the large bay window. Had the store been open, I thought to myself. I
probably would have bought it with what few dollars I have left.
I walk pass the shut down adult store and a double-wide McDonalds that
was built out of necessity to provide for those less fortunate. The spot, which is
conveniently named The Spot, is right next store to the fat factory. I grab the
tarnished bronze handle and pull.
Inside the tiny venue is a bar and a small stage. The carpet is plush and
red. The walls are a disgusting mixture of pink with hearts, with hues of deep
blues scattered randomly overtop. It’s ugly and beautiful at the same time. I go

straight for the bar and order a vodka-7. The bartender, Jillian, asks me if she
wants me to hold anything for me. I nod and hand her the remaining two beers.
She labels them with my name, “Charley,” and places them in the ice box. I sip at
my vodka-7 and wait for 9 o’clock to roll around.
After some time passed, and I finished my first vodka-7, I looked up at the
clock that hangs on the wall I’m facing. It has a moldy green portrait of Benjamin
Franklin as the background, with numbers that are written identically to those
that are presented on currency. Money is inescapable, I think to myself as the
clock rolls onto 8:33pm. Jillian glances over at me. She’s a large woman, with
thick thighs and broad shoulders. Her build is almost reminiscent of a man’s,
except she has these cannons that she likes to let hangout, perhaps to remind the
patrons that she is a woman after-all, despite her large frame.

!
“So how’s the writing going, Charley?”

“Oh. Just fine Jillian. I’m working on my latest novel these days.”

!
“What’s it about?”

!
“I don’t know yet. Can you get me another drink?”

!
“Can you actually pay for this one? The last one was your house drink for
reading and I’m not picking up anymore of your tabs.”

!
“Of course I can pay for this one.”

!
Jillian glares at me then reluctantly mixes me up another vodka-7. She
slides me the drink down the rail.

!
“So where the hell are you going to get a real job? You look like shit.”

!
“I feel great.”

!
“You know you can’t live like this. Bumming off each woman that feels
sorry for your pitiful ass. Being a writer is no excuse to live this way.”

!
“I feel more alive living like this than any other man who has a decent job.
They just waste away behind a desk, and for what? A nice retirement plan? The
hell with that!” I throw back my vodka-7, downing half of it. This is all I ever hear
from people anymore. This is why I can’t stand being around people very long.
They all just act concerned for my well-being, when they don’t really know what
is good for my well-being. How else do they ever expect me to make it in life with a
dull day job that leaves no time for me living? They just don’t understand the
requirements of the occupation I pursue.

!
As I continue my pre-reading ritual of drinking to numb myself, I hear the
door open then close. The first of the crowd, I think to myself. The first lemming. I
take another sip and ignore the audience member.
The crowds haven’t been very big, which I am fine with. I don’t enjoy
reading much, but it gets my shit out there and that is what is important. By
getting to the place early I’m able to gauge the size of the crowd before going on
stage. It’s good to do so as not to be overwhelmed once you did get up there. It’s
part of my pre-reading ritual. My preparation. I’ll be relieved if it’s a small draw
tonight. I haven’t written anything worthy of a large draw recently. Although,
tonight I will be reading something new. Even this piece isn’t worthy of any more
than fifteen ears. I get wrapped up in thinking about the crowd size when the
lemming takes a seat next to me. I turn to see who it is. I stay at the face, trying
to remember where I’ve seen that face before when it hit me.

!
“You wouldn’t happen to be Rachel Le’Oré, would you?”

!
I could feel my lungs start to tighten with nervousness just sitting in her
presence. She turned her head gently towards me.
“I would happen to be,” she tells me with a French wisp in her words. She
turns back towards the bartender and lights up a cigarette. It’s thin and elegant
looking, much like her.

!

I look up at Jillian and hold up two fingers. She rolls her eyes at me, but
complies. Moments later, two vodka-7’s are placed in front of us. Rachel Le’Oré
looks at the drink, then back up at me. She flashed a subtle smile, then nipped at
the drink.

!
“How do you do it?”

!
“Do what?”

!
“Make it? Stay calm for readings? Be successful? How’d you do it?” I asked her,
my words were beginning to slur. The vodka was winning the war.

!
“Don’t be a young hot shot, for starters.”

!
“You’re young though.”

!
“I’m almost forty.”

!
“Well shit, you don’t look a day older than your twenties.”

!

She laughed lightly and continued talking, “As for staying calm during readings,
just breathe. Just remember that they come to listen, regardless whether it’s
good or bad. And don’t drink too much or eat too much before hand.”

!
“Guess I’m fucked on the drinking aspect.” I slug down the half-cup of remaining
Vodka-7 and order a beer and a shot of whiskey to go with it.

!
“You should slow down if you’re reading.”

!
“I’ll be all right. How’d you become so successful?”

!
“Patience. It’s all about patience and perseverance. Don’t stop when you think
you should, don’t stop when you’re told you should. Just clock in, put your time
in, and never stop putting pen to the paper. Even if it’s not at a very convenient
time. The more you write, the more likely you’re going to have that one thing that
is good and is going to take you places. Just always remember, you are you’re
words.”

!
I look into her eyes, hypnotized. Her words floated right through me. I’m caught
in this drunken trance over her again until a patron bumps in-between us. I snap
back to reality. I look up at the clock. It’s 9:01pm. The show is about to start and
I’m headlining. I finish my drink and head around to the back of the stage to do
some final reads and finish my pre-reading ritual.

I peek from behind the curtain at the crowd. Full house. I’m sweating
terribly now. My gut is in knots. I go to the bathroom in the final minutes I have
remaining before the reading starts and begin vomiting.
“You all right, sir?” A gentleman in the bathroom stall to me left asks me.

!
“Yes, yes. I’m fine. I’m reading tonight.”

!
“First time? I can see how that could get to a man, especially with Rachel Le’Oré
following you up.”

!
“It’s not my first time reading.”

!
“Oh.” The man hastily wiped then flushed.

!
Over the loudspeaker, I heard my name being called to go on stage. I
splashed some water on my face, dried it, then left for the stage. As I made my
approach, I dug around in my pockets for my nights reading material. My hands
furiously wandered all over my body, frantically trying to find them in one of the
four pockets I had on my person. Switch swiftly between butt pockets to side
pockets, my jeans were empty.

!
“Damn!”

!

Rachel looks over at me. “Everything all right?”

!
“Yes, yes, yes. Everything is fine!”

!
I grabbed a napkin and quickly scribble down some words. I can’t help
thinking to myself, “Maybe this is my first time.” I walk out on stage as they call
my name for the final time before moving on to another candidate who’d like to
read. I stand, center stage, covered in sweat. I swallow hard, clear my throat and
begin.

!
“This is a new poem I wrote. The only poem I brought with me. I’ll make it short
and sweet so we can get Rachel up here fast as possible. Okay. Here we go. This
one is called “Wounded Dogs:”

!
!
we’re all just
wounded dogs,
bleeding out.
waiting for
something;
anything
that could
save

us.

!
The crowd remains silent. No one claps immediately, but slowly, looking
around at each other with confused faces, they begin to clap. It builds and builds
until there is thunder in the room. No one is standing, although, a few stood then
sat right back down. There I stood, center-stage, applause washing over me. I
acted grateful, but deep down I hated it. I knew no one would love my words, love
me this much. Over from the bar, I heard a soft boo under the thunder. It was just
barely strong enough to kiss my ear. I looked over and Rachel was booing me. Her
face was serious, yet there was a smile locked on it. Finally, I think to myself, the
truth.
