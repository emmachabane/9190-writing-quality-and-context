The train’s air was hot and dry and the dust caked his
throat.

Outside the

Only the sun

The bright white sun.

He’d look out the window and point and some guy would
stand up and in a proud bow say, “Rajasthan,” and gesture
towards the vast desert with a wide sweep of the hand.
Later on, when Marc asked the same question he got the same
answer.

Yes, it’s still Rajasthan.

Endless Rajasthan.

Always Rajasthan.

Eternal Rajasthan.

The sun flared, and blue-green circles streaked across
his mind.

He thought of New York and how lovely everything

was back then.
Helena’s silky blonde hair was draped over the pillow,
and her glossy blue eyes were flecked with tiny spots of
desire.

He ran his thumb over her high and angled

cheekbones, and across her soft pink lips, and down to her
delicate chin.

He felt her soft stomach, and kissed her

bellybutton.
“I’m pregnant.”
“What?”

And then, “that’s great.”

“You want to keep it?”

“Yes.

Don’t you?”

“Yes.”
“Then, why’d you ask me?”
“I wanted to see what you’d say.”
“Oh, okay.

But I do.

And I love you too.”

But he didn’t really mean it.
“I know.”
“Do you love me?”
“Yes.”
“Say it.”
“I love you.”
But in the end, he left her.
“But do you really love me?”
“Yes,” but he wasn’t sure.
“How do you know?”
“I just know,” Marc said.
“How do you know that you love me?”
“That’s a bad question,” she said.

“Don’t ask me that

question.”
Marc blinked.

His pupils were nothing but tiny

pinpricks that stared back at the distant world.
Six years later, on a listless train through
Rajasthan, he heard her words again, “That’s a bad
question.

Don’t ask me that question.”

Rajastan’s endless landscape was going by like a wavy
white line.

And out beyond the desert was emptiness.

The train stopped, and the stagnant air stirred
slightly as a woman dressed in all black, with a black veil
covering her face, lumbered aboard.

She sat down with a

heavy sigh and the languid rocking began again.

Marc

didn’t want to look, but he did, and the woman’s oldflattened face turned towards him.

The white-hot sun poked

through her veil, and bounced off a blank metallic eye.
The eye was moist and silvery and it fit perfectly into her
red-rimmed eye socket.

A shudder ran down to the base his

spine.
“Good,” the old woman said, as she lifted up the
strange purplish fruit.

Her eye’s emptiness bore into him,

and he understood Poe’s, “A Telltale Heart,” all too well.
It was the Eye, the Eye that made him do it.
“No thanks,” Marc’s dry throat cracked.
The old woman laughed a deep laugh, and her one good
eye darted around.
A skinny man in a thin suit reached into his pocket
and pulled out a few old and jagged coins and handed them
to the one-eyed woman.

She lifted the wooden stick that

separated the cast iron plates.
“It’s Karonda.”

The skinny man in the thin suit said

to Marc.
“Oh.”
“We eat it for dessert.”
Marc looked at him; it was good to know someone spoke
English.
“You don’t want to try it?”
“No, that’s okay.”

He said.

The skinny man squeezed the fruit and ate its clear
pulp.
“Good.”

The old woman said again, but her veiled grin

only looked like a caricature of a smiling mask.
Marc sat still, as the skinny man in the thin suit
sucked down the juicy fruit.
“You eat,” she said, and her blank eye pressed in on
him.

Marc was beginning to think that there was some kind

of tractor-beam magic behind that eye.
The skinny man said, “It’s safe.”

The fruit’s bittersweet pulp quenched his dry

throat.

It felt good to feel something.

Marc looked

around the car and saw the Rajasthanis politely smiling
with their eyes.

Everyone seemed satisfied now.

Come drink.”

The one-eyed woman

waved Marc into the circle.
He found a skinny man in a thin suit.
“Baba, is this water okay to drink?”
“For me, yes!

For you, no!”

The skinny man laughed.

Marc walked back to the train and the swirling dust
flakes danced in the sunlight.
He began to write.

“It’s just like changing your clothes.”
“What?” I said.
“Death,” he said.

“This guy died, but now, already,

he’s being reborn into a different body.”

A small boy came up to Marc.

He sat down and placed

his hands on Marc’s shoulders, as if they were old friends.
He gazed down at the strange letters on the page.

The boy

made a face – disappointed that there were no pictures.
“Life’s but a dream,” Marc explained.
“English.

No,” was what the boy said.

And then he

walked off.
Life’s a dream, all right.

A Great Big Dream to you

and me.
And death?
Just like changing your clothes.
