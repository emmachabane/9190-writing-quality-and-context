Ray was walking down the sidewalk under the shade of the
maple trees that the city planted during some forgotten arbor
day project so many years ago he didn’t remember it being bare.
These projects were popular in his part of his city once on a
time.

Beautification projects that never seemed to help his

neighborhood, not unless a wave of Californians came in behind
and bought and gentrified everything.

Fortunately for Ray that

had never happened here; the line of progressive bistros and
trendy coffee shops drew short somewhere north about ten blocks.
That meant that he hadn’t had to move in his entire adult life,
and that’s exactly how he liked it.
He was taking his 4000th stroll on this exact sidewalk.
Actually, 4223rd stroll.

He couldn’t explain why he knew that or

how he kept track. It sometimes happens that men in ridiculously
unextraordinary lives do intrinsically extraordinary things like

the same sidewalk to the same bar despite nearly universal
apathy about most things.

This was every day of the week,

especially now that he was retired.

Except, of course, Sundays.

He usually spent Sundays at home with his wife Laura.

Despite

having not been in a church since his son died in the war, he
kept hold of that old-fashioned notion that Sundays were the
Lord’s day.

Which meant he had to go to the grocery store on

Saturday to make sure he had a half rack of PBJs to watch NFL
football.
But today was Saturday, and though he would never know it,
every one of those staccato footsteps on the old worn sidewalk
was Ray’s form of meditation.

During nearly every one of those

4223 trips, nothing changed, and that quiet form of numb comfort
felt like a warm shirt out of the dryer.
However, the usual banal march was not to be his today.

He

looked down the same grimy alley he had passed all those times
with the same dirty dumpster.

Today there was a dog with his

ecstatic over whatever scrap he had found in the alley.

Despite

himself, Ray stopped and looked, and when the dog turned around
there was a plastic bag fitting loosely over the dog’s head from
the Chinese take-out place he and Laura ordered from once a
month or so.

The dog licked his jowls and wagged his tail and

The Overtime / 3

Ray let out a small laugh.

His first one in quite some time.

He didn’t have a meter for that.

The dog wagged his tail a few

more times and returned to his meal, bag still on his head like
a distorted baker’s hat.

Ray stared for a while longer and

realized he was smiling.

He turned and continued his stroll.

Walking up to the entrance of the Overtime Tavern, things
returned to normal, the sights, sounds, and smells to his
liking.

He looked at the flyers taped to the inside of the

windows beneath the neon signs promoting various watered-down
beers and noted for the umpteenth time, some had been hanging
there since Clinton was in office, yellowed, sun-bleached and
barely readable.

This was a place suspended in amber, with only

a few changes here and there.

A few times a year the owner

would try a new beer on tap only to quickly pull it after a few
weeks after putting the pints on severe discount.

acquaintances and fellow Overtime denizens (Ray didn’t really
consider any of these people friends, more like extended family)
George would hover like a hawk and wait for the keg to go on
discount.

And, of course, bitch about the taste of the beer

with every dollar pint he put down on the way to happy town.
Opening the door, he noticed one of the changes to come
along in the last few years, though it was so common now it
wasn’t noticeable so much.

There was a table full of twenty-

The Overtime / 4

something hipsters drinking PBJ and taking themselves very
seriously, the skinny boys in old-fashioned beards that were
wearing them instead of the other way around, and the girls
trying their best to look like nothing in particular, but as a
result, standing out.

Two of the group were at the ancient red

velvet pool table playing a game in a nonchalant manner.
Apparently, it was now a thing with this generation to visit
community dive bars as a sort of social awareness experiment.
That and the beer was a fraction of the cost at the million brew
pubs that had sprung up in the city in the last twenty years.
Ray wondered for the hundredth time if they were scouts sent
ahead by the future gentrification mafia to establish a
beachhead.
The same exact smell greeted him as he walked up to the
bar, grease from the deep fryer, stale beer from the drip trays,
the chemical smell of the fly strips, and a smell that he could
only describe as yesterday --- non-descript, but somehow no
longer belonging to the present.

Ray was surprised to see Dave

the Bartender behind the bar (it is a known fact that every dive
bar in America has a bartender named Dave).

Without asking Dave

said, “Amanda met someone on one of those dating sites and asked
me to cover for her.”

Ray nodded.

Amanda was the ubiquitous

young lady that was cute and full of attitude that you could

often find in bars like this; it seemed every bar had one and
Ray felt a small twinge of disappointment to see Dave.
Ray sat down and a half dozen men and one couple playing
pull tabs nodded or said a small greeting.

Maybe everybody knew

his name, but no one shouted it out like on TV.

The bar got quiet and Tony elbowed Jeff in the ribs, hoping
Ray didn’t notice.

He did.

“My son’s life insurance helped us out.” He said matter-offactly as he took another swig and noticed his can was empty.
He waved at Dave for another.

Jeff stared at Ray for a full 30

seconds before muttering his apology.

“No problem.”

The caesura in the bar’s rhythm was over quickly.

Jeff were arguing the politics of taxes and the price of real
estate.

Ray took several more swallows of his beer glancing

briefly at the college football game that was on the TV directly
above his head.

The meter temporarily stuck, he zoned out and

didn’t even notice the stranger until he was standing at the bar

Several stunned seconds ticked by and Jeff simply said,
“Ray, what the fuck?”
Ray put the bottle back on the bar where he found it and stood
looking at The Man.

Nobody offered help.

Nobody said a word.

The only sound was from The Man, and incredibly it sounded like
he was chuckling.
The next surreal moment happened as the door to the bar
slowly opened and the afternoon sunlight silhouetted a figure
who materialized into a very large man wearing a dark suit and
Oakley sunglasses.

He walked over to The Man without looking at

anyone in the bar and put one arm around his waist.

He steadied

The Man to his feet and asked, “Sir, are you okay?”
The Man smiled through his wince, one hand on the welt on
his head.
