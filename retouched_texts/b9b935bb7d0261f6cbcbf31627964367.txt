I was supposed to meet him at 7 pm. I waited for 1 ½ hours and
left. He had done this to me several times before. Maybe he
thought that I wait for him or pity him enough to take him back.
My life changed and there wasn’t a reason to go back to anyone
in my past. Yet he felt that he could come back right into my
life and pick up from where we left off.
I waited for another 15 minutes in the cold to catch a cab,
forgetting us and starting over again. Just when I opened the
door to my apartment, I got a phone call from his mother. She
told me that he died in a car collision on his way to see me and
how he missed me terribly. She said he changed so much over
the years and he anticipated meeting me again.
I got a little drunk and dug out the picture box I saved of all the
pictures we took together over the years. I cried horribly. And
still I couldn’t understand why it took him so long to come back
to me, or at least to say he’s sorry for having hurt me so deeply.
He really did it this time. He really, really did it this time, and
he’s leaving me behind. I felt empty inside and broken to
pieces. I drank the last bit of wine there was left in this black
apothecary bottle and sat motionless on the couch for awhile.
Absurdly, he used to get wine in black bottles too, and I cried
hideously over that thought. Then the throbbing bounce in my
head took over. It must have been 3 o’clock in the morning
when I dozed off.
I have woke up and went out to the lake near my home to get
some air. I looked out into the horizon and let of him. He had
hurt me so much while we were together. Yet I still parted with
good thoughts and hoped he would become the man I knew he
could be. It was hard to forget him because he had been such an
important person in my life. Now, I'll never be able to tell him
that it was okay, I survived and he's not to blame for hurting me.
The End
