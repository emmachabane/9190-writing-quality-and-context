## Retouched Sixfold data
TL;DR: you will probably want to use the versions of the stories presented in `sixfold/ascii_texts` and catalogued in `filtered_overview.csv` for any experiments. In what follows I give more detail on how these (and the other retouched files) were created. There are other miscellanous things I have coded, but if your workflow differs from mine they may not be useful.

There are three modified things here: `filtered_overview.csv`, `sixfold/retouched_texts`, and `sixfold/ascii_texts`. These are, respectively, modifications of `overview.csv` and the sixfold `texts/` .txt files that appear on the server somerset (not mirrored here to avoid confusion). There is also a new file, `sixfold_competition_types.csv`, which classifies each of the competitionIds as either belonging to the fiction or poetry contest. I will explain what was done to create each of these.
