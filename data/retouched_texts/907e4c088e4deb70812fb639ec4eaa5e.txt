“Nice ass.”
She twirls around her glow-in-the-dark white body,
barely covered by a black bikini, and her flying out
shoulder-length blonde hair.

“Wanna dance?”

she asks.

“Nah, I’m too old for that stuff.”
She smiles.

“You don’t have to do anything but sit.

I do all the work.”
“I mean I’m so old I might have a heart attack.”
”Sure,” she quips derisively.
“Anyway, I need to go outside for a smoke.”

I walk away, push through the swinging doors to a
short, dark hallway and then turn the knob on the heavy
metal door to the outside.
A grey limo, like a whale out of water, stretches
across the No Parking zone about thirty feet from the
entrance.

Both doors on this side of the main compartment

are spread open, exposing a plush grey interior with two
six packs of Bud on the floor, the legs of a guy and a girl
in the back seat and those of a guy facing them.
My pool buddy, George, stands off to the side smoking.
There’s no cover charge at the Wild Goose and he is
recently retired so he spends most of his evenings here,
picking up free beers from chumps like me and some serious
cash from guys who think they are pool sharks. Black as an
eight ball, with a trim figure and his black hair greying
at the temples, he contrasts with my mid-fifties cue ball
whiteness, prominent paunch and bald head. He doesn’t seem
to notice that there are a lot of girls walking around in
very abbreviated outfits, while I, despite what I said to
the blonde with the nice ass, am an easy mark for the girls
and my factory job doesn’t pay me enough to spend a lot of
time here.

FEAR 3
“What’s going on?” I ask.
He smiles, “They seem to be looking for some girls.”
A white clean shaven man in his early forties wearing
dress shoes, grey slacks and a crisp white dress shirt
walks over to us from the limo.

“You guys know any of the

girls inside?”
George stares at the guy, making clear that he thinks
this an impertinent question.

He steps out his cigarette,

“Scuze me” and walks back inside.
“I know a few,” I say.
He shakes my hand.

them are going to get into a strange car.”
“They can drive their own car and follow us.”
“It’s not gonna happen.”
He grunts.

“Hey, wanna beer?”

“Sure.”
“Get him a beer,” he barks to the limo.

The legs of the guy in the back seat become a big
chubby Hispanic guy with a round face and a put-upon manner
who stoops forward.

He wears a faded light blue dress

shirt tucked in and hanging over his belt, Fila tennis
shoes and a small towel hanging from a rear pocket of his
tan pants.

Mid-twenties.

He pulls a Bud from its plastic

sleeve, and I step forward to accept it.

I now see the

white girl in the back seat, wearing a red dress and black
heels.

Short and thin, with a nice figure, she has on

thick makeup to hide what is clearly not a great
complexion.

I also get a clear view of the tall, handsome

guy with thick blond hair combed back sitting opposite
them.

The director points to him: “This is Ray Faldo.

He’s been in six episodes of Days of Our Lives.”

Ray

stoops to get out of the limo and steps forward to shake my
hand.
“They kill you off?”
“Nah, they just kinda forgot about me.”
The director asks me, “You want to come with us?

“Can I ask George if he wants to go along?”
“Sure.

Who’s George?”

“The black guy I was talking to.”
“Okay.”
Back inside, I pause to let my eyes adjust to the dim
light.

I walk alongside the bar and see George on his

stool at the end of it, next to the pool table, drinking a
Coors. “Wanna go watch ‘em make a movie?”
“Nah, that group looks kinda shaky to me.

Besides, I

“Ah, come on, bring it with you.

“No thanks.

As I come back out, a good looking, muscular young

strides past me.

The director barks, “Let’s go.”

The director turns to me, “You coming?”

“I’ll drive my car and follow.”
He says “Okay.

It’s not far.”

The limo slowly backs out of its No Parking place. I
get in my shiny two-week-old 2000 black Camry, named Black

Beauty, and move in behind it. The lights cooperate and I
keep the limo in sight.

I don’t mind if I lose them.

Maybe George is right; I

don’t need to be doing this.
We drive about twenty minutes, into Santa Monica.

I

get stopped twice by red lights but they get stopped at the
next ones so it’s easy for me to catch up.

Something wants me to do this.

Maybe they’ll have a

part for a bald-headed guy with a paunch.
The limo pulls into an alley with a sharp uphill
grade.

I know we are near the ocean because I can smell

the seaweed and stranded shellfish and there is often a
raised area like the one producing this grade about a
quarter of a mile in from the shore.

They park and I pull

in ten feet behind the limo. Except for the driver, they
all get out and walk up some stairs with a metal railing.
Paul unlocks the sliding glass door and they walk into the
back of a second floor apartment.

No one says anything to

me or even seems to notice me so I stay in the car.

about ten minutes, the two Hispanics, the big chubby one
and the muscular one, and the girl come out and walk down
the steps.

Muscles sees me. “We’re goin’ for a walk.”
“Gotcha.”

At least someone recognized me.
The girl seems a reluctant participant.

She gives me

a timid smile despite her apparent uneasiness as they walk
by.

They head down the alley and around the hedge at the

base of it.
A few minutes later the director and Ray “Days of Our
Lives” Faldo come out.

The director locks the sliding

glass door and they come down the steps and into the limo.
They pay no attention to me and take off up the alley.

As

they drive off, the two Hispanics and the girl walk into
the base of the alley.

The muscular one yells, “Hey, what

about us!”
The limo continues up the alley.
Muscles grabs the girl by the arm and walks quickly
back into the street, the girl tripping over her heels as
she frantically tries to keep up.

I guess he’s hoping to flag down the limo if it comes
that way.

FEAR 8
I‘ve had enough so I get in the car and back out of
the alley into the street.

I see the two Hispanics

standing in front of the girl, Muscles pushing her against
a parked car with his forearm across her throat.

I back up

until I am about five feet from them, open the window on
the passenger side and ask, “Miss, do you need a ride?”
Muscles, his handsome face contorted in anger, takes
quick strides toward my car, reaches in, opens the door,
slides into the seat, turns the key off and pulls it out of
the ignition.

“Get out.”

What the hell!

Who does he think he is!

But I’m not

messing with him cause he could mess me up bad.
I get out.

He also gets out, comes around, gets in

the driver’s seat, peels forward, jerks to a stop, peels
backwards, scrapes the rear hubcap on the curb with a loud
screech as he parks and gets out.

“Over here by the fence,

Kneel down, facing the fence.”

Oh my god, get me out of this alive.
Chubby grabs the girl’s arm and pushes her toward the
fence.

She places her hand on his and pleads, “You’re

hurting my arm.”
He says, “Shut up and kneel.”
I kneel down beside her.

FEAR 9

What an idiot I am!

Why didn’t I just take off!

Why

didn’t I pick up on what George was trying to tell me!
Muscles turns to Chubby, “Watch ‘em.

I’ll see if Paul

at least left the apartment open.”

I saw Paul lock it but I’m not saying anything.
Muscles would probably take it out on me.
The girl whispers in her timid voice, “Sorry I got you
into this.

Do what they say.”

Chubby barks, “No talking.”
Muscles returns.

“The bastard.”

He paces behind us, repeatedly slamming his right fist
into his left hand.

My car!

If you take it, how are we going to get home?

A white cop car with a blue diagonal stripe across the
side and POLICE in gold letters across the doors slows and
stops.

It is about thirty feet away.

The spotlight shines

on us and we hear the window roll down.
“What’s going on here,” growls the cop.
Muscles stoops and whispers to me, “Say anything and
I’ll cut your balls off.”

Surely the cop will walk over here to investigate.

You think you can find her place?”

“Yeh, it’s close.

Take a right at the light, drive

half a mile and look for Hudson Lane on the left.

It’s

We find it.

It becomes very dark in the alley, which

is paved but so narrow that the unkempt shrubs brush
against both sides of the car like the claws of a hawk.

Damn!

Two weeks old and Black Beauty needs a paint

job.
When I get halfway up the alley, Chubby leans forward.
“Stop here.”

dark grey house the size of a big shed.

He walks in but soon comes back

“No one’s here.”
“See if you can find some cash.”
Chubby goes back in.
Headlights appear at the top of the alley.
Muscles yells, “Get inna goddamn car.

Quick.”

Chubby leaves the door ajar, bounds down the steps and
gets in the back seat.

I begin to back out of the alley.

“This ain’t no fuckin picnic!” screams Muscles.

He jams

his left foot onto my right one on the accelerator.

A

telephone pole takes off the mirror on my side and scrapes
the side of the car.
The girl yells, “We’re going to crash!”

Muscles takes his foot off mine.

I back out the rest

of the way as fast as I can without hitting anything else.
I squeal to a stop on the main street and squeal again as I
take off, slowing down after half a block.

As I suspected,

the car isn’t following us.
“You didn't need that mirror,” sneers Muscles.

“You

He grabs the rearview mirror,

pulls it off the windshield, and throws it out the window.
“Just don’t drive backwards.”
Chubby chuckles.
Muscles commands, “Keep driving at the speed limit.
Don’t do anything that’d make somebody notice us.”

Okay, asshole, but already my new car is a piece of
junk.
We drive around Santa Monica and Culver City for an
hour.

It is 3 AM.

There is some scuffling in the back seat.

pleads to Chubby, “Please don’t do that.”
I screech to a stop and yell, “What’s going on back

Chubby grunts but there are no more scuffling noises
from the back seat.
We drive around some more.

the alley for the limo but it doesn’t arrive.

suggests robbing a convenience store.

Oh swell, we’ll probably total the car this time.

“Nah, I wanna go home.

We’re

Forty minutes later we are almost to Long Beach but I
am running out of gas.

“I need to get off and get some

gas.”
“Okay, but keep your fuckin mouth shut.”
I see a sign for a Mobil station lit up, exit from the
freeway, and pull in next to a pump.
“Remember, jackoff, just pay for the gas and keep your
mouth shut.”
“Okay.”

He should know by now that I wouldn’t try anything.

I

let the cop slip by so why would I take a chance on saying
something to a gas station attendant.
I’m surprised that my scraped door opens.

I fill her

up and give a fifty to the rumpled-looking guy in the
booth.

He swipes the bill to see if it’s counterfeit,

sticks it in his cash drawer and gives me change.

back in the car.
“Get back onna 405 and keep heading south.
