Marc saw his first dead body in Varanasi.

It was

floating in the water like a piece of contorted driftwood.
Its face was eaten away, and he could see its white skull
and into the hollow sockets where the eyes once were.

The

bottom jaw was gone, but the top teeth were still there.
It seemed to be laughing.
“It’s just like changing your clothes,” the boatman
said.
“What?” Marc said.
“Death,” the man said as he pulled at the oars.

“This

man died, but now he’s already being reborn into a
different body.”

The boatman looked around and smiled.

“All this is an illusion.

Life’s but a dream.”

Rajasthan.

Yes, it’s still Rajasthan.

Endless Rajasthan.

Always

Eternal Rajasthan.

Six years earlier Marc and Helena had lived in New
York and everything was lovely then.
Helena’s silky blonde hair was draped over the pillow,
and her glossy blue eyes were flecked with spots of desire.
He ran his thumb over her angled cheekbones, and across her
soft pink lips, down her delicate chin and over her chest.
He kissed her bellybutton.

“I’m pregnant.”
“What?”

There was a pause and then he said, “that’s

great.”
“You want to keep it?” she asked.
“Yes.

Do you?”

“Yes.”
“Then, why’d you ask me?”
“I wanted to see what you’d say.”
“Oh, okay.

But I do.

And I love you.”

“But do you really love me?”
“Yes.”
“How do you know?” she asked.
“I just know,” Marc said.
Helena looked away.
“Well, do you love me?” Marc asked.
“Yes, of course.”

Helena was looking at the edge of

the pillow.
“Say it.”
She looked at him.

“I love you.”

“But how do you know that you love me?” he asked her.
“That’s a bad question,” she said.

“You shouldn’t ask

me that question.”

It was good to know someone who

Marc and Helena were part of the New York scene.

At

people, the drugs, the money, the freedom, the sky, the

They loved it all.

Marc looked up and saw a boy approaching him.

they were old friends.
“Life’s but a dream,” Marc explained.

And then suddenly, the boy stopped.

“English, you pay.”

The boy held out his hand, as the

blood was trickling down his bumpy ribcage.
Marc put a couple of rupees in the boy’s outstretched
hand.

The boy took them, closed his hand and walked

towards the fire.

Marc watched the boy’s silhouette melt

into the bright flames.

The train stopped somewhere in the nowhere desert.
The funeral pyres were a long way away now.

The sun had

set and all that warmth and light was gone.

It was cold.

Everyone got off the train and gathered around an old
cement well.

They took turns gulping down water from a

large ladle.

Marc could smell the water and it smelled

sweet the way true freshwater does.
“Drink.

Drink.

Come drink.”

The one-eyed woman

waved Marc into the circle.
Marc found the skinny man in the thin suit and grabbed
his arm.

“Baba, is this water okay to drink?”

“For me, yes!

For you, no!”

The skinny man laughed.

Marc let go of the man’s arm and walked back to the
train and the swirling dust danced in the moonlight.

Marc

sat in the empty train and thought back to that dead body
floating in Varanasi.
