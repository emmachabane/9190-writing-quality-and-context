(I am married to a man who is two women
I would not seek either one as a friend...)
The first order of levitation is to drift
things that are
not
attached
a rogue balloon
disappeared string
a glance away when I’m looking at you
our hearts drift
hollowing out hand made spaces
things that are
not
attached
words with
pauses between them so that
you have to pay attention when
I’m not looking
but don’t.
I drift
hollowing out places
hijacked pieces
of empty carried afar so far that
you are in another country
sitting here
not hooked in.

(in the dream of sharp edges it is easy to forget/ things are linear/ rigid/ then fall away/ the
anesthesiologist assures no pain/ only color/ then comes unremembering the blue of his eyes)

One morning we will wake up…
and remember to find/ the good in what has happened before and/ seek the tube of glue we have
been using to/ put things back together/ and realize that it is gone/used up/ and that it is holding
we do not need to buy more
one morning we will wake up
and the air will be fresh and light with a chill/bursting our new found lungs with fresh/ the
sun beating its wild wings will/ beg to get in/ pushing aside the dark crows at the window
and we will let it
(we will let it light the place we kept dark for so long/ we will open the windows/ to the room we
built to house shadows/ flush with dark feathers/ dreams we buried under stones lodged to hold it
all safe down )
one morning we will wake up
and spit out ash/ from the fire that consumed what we were/ that family of the before time: flush
white/ privileged stuffed/ fat and done so that no random quirk or fall of fate could touch us until
the carnage/ that licked at the suspicion of/ forward
one day my love/ we will wake up
and what we were we will remember/ as something still beating in/ this fragile winged fleeting
a lesson in survival/ a primer in stopping to stop/ an assignment in reset/ an invitation to dance
(our feet undancing memories of what/ was/:to be uncertain /ostracized/ blanketed in bad luck
and we …)
one morning we will wake up
and I will see you back/ in the way back before/ before the house the dog the cats all of which
have changed/ places like musical chairs/ and we will dance the old dance/reinventing humility
and the chairs are a fiction in a dream that sings now.
