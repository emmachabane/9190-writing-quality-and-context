Piloting

mechanical device; nevertheless, I tried to bring my mind
forward to the present as I brought the ship in close to dock.

“Personnel?” I paused for a moment.

“Personnel onboard

I looked down to the manifest.
“Dex Alterman.

The intercom was quiet except for the soft static.

Titan was the largest of them all.

thousands of feet above the surface between the Moon and
Earth.

I entered the elevator that would coast down to the

surface.

Outside the window, the androids began to unload the

cargo from under the ship, sending it down the banded freight
cart that rode the tether.

I watched as the crates locked onto

the lift and started down the line.
I looked away from the lift to the large rock floating in
the distance.

It was a ghost of its former self.

I had looked

at it a thousand times before, watching dawn break on one edge
as dusk settled to twinkling lights on the other, oceans
outlining each continent, each one as unique as the others—all
of these were just memories now.

I hesitated for a second. “Yes.”
“Please make sure you have all information ready at the
checkpoint.”

I felt my breast pocket once more for reassurance.

“No problem.”
“We are also confirming identification via retinal
scanner.

We have had a rash of fraudulent papers from smugglers

ever since the crash, so we are doing 100% inspections now.”
I wasn’t sure if it was the acceleration downward or my
nerves, but I began to feel queasy as the elevator glided down
to the surface.

Papers were one thing, a retinal scanner was

another ordeal entirely.
I exited the elevator quietly.

Now would be the only time

to slip away without detection.

Perhaps I could hide somewhere

and come out after a few hours.

I looked around.

I patted my jacket, feeling

for the imaginary note.
“That’s fine,” said the officer, “you can always try your
luck the other way.”

He slapped the sign hanging above him.

I forced out a chuckle and placed my head on the chin strap
of the device.

With a click of a button, the machine’s lens

opened and shined a red light into my eyes. What would the
results show?

I tried to read the officer’s expression, but his

face was turned away staring at the results on the screen.
“Stay here,” the officer said turning around.

“I just need

to check something with my superior officer.”
Now I began to panic.

As I rolled over, I saw the brown haired guard standing

over me, fading into blackness.
I could feel the swelling of my face as it pulsed with warm
blood, spilling out of capillaries, forming bruises on my face.
“Easy there, you’re not going anywhere.”
I opened my eyes, the face of the officer came into
focus.
“What was that all about?” said the guard.
I tried to speak, but my tongue felt swollen.

“However, considering the fleet is short pilots right now—
and the mountain of paperwork to process fraudulent papers—my
superior is inclined to let you off with a fine for an expired
ID, as long as you keep quiet about this whole matter.”
The guard gripped my shoulder tightly with his large hands,
“Isn’t that right Mr. Alterman?”
What did he say?

My mind began to catch up as the room

stopped spinning.
“You just need to take an eye image for the Fed records,”
he said as he pulled me up from the ground.
I tried to reply, eventually managing to nod in agreement.
“Now, if you don’t mind, we will just take a few more
minutes to update your profile and you can be on your way.”
The officer sat me down and tapped on his computer
keyboard.

The brown haired guard brought over an ice pack and

placed it on my face.
“Here you are Mr. Alterman. You are free to go.”
My legs still numb, I hobbled forward and grabbed the
registration and ID from the officer.
He patted me on the back, “I would get to the sick bay and

The contents rolled down the arms, heaped from
