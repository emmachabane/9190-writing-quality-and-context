Doug stared out his office window, the window he'd worked
nearly thirty years to earn in the cubicle world of computer
engineering, but he saw nothing.

His true gaze was focussed

"Alright," Travis said.
"Could we meet?"

In a professional matter."
"What is it?"

"Sure," Doug could hear the click as Travis checked the
calendar on his phone.

"How about next Thursday?"

"This can't wait.
"Yeah.

Can you meet for a drink after work?"

It'll be late, though.

"No," Doug said.

Is everything okay?"

"I don't think so."

"Do you want to tell me about it?"
"Yeah.

Travis waited as the barmaid set down his Jack Daniels.

Doug took a deep breath and let it out.

Irene
Irene turned on the evening news every night while she made
dinner not because she wanted to see the news, but because Wheel
of Fortune came on immediately after, and she liked guessing the
puzzles as she cooked.

It was one of the many little rituals

that made up her life.

That night was no different.

Beth nodded, and Irene saw, then, that that was marriage.
That was what it was, and everyone who was married understood
that.

Everyone except her.

She felt the heat of this

knowledge, so long hidden from her, or, more likely, rejected by
her, and she wanted Beth to have something, too, something that
had to do with that knowledge, something more than just the
money.
"How about you?" she asked, meaning, have you noticed any
major changes.
"Well, I didn't get my picture on the news," Beth said a
little resentfully.
"True.

Sorry about that," Irene said, in all seriousness,

and they both laughed, then, at the utter insanity of what they
were saying.

Of what they had done.

"Have you spent any of it?" Beth changed the subject
slightly.
"Nope.

lament.
"No.

Probably not."

"But what a story for the grandkids."

used to, with fire and need, Irene remembered a conversation oft
