The second attempt at mending my broken heart fell in vein to the spoils of my malevolent
shadow.
I needed to find my soul.
A scavenger hunt that always ended in narcotics or failed New Year's resolutions.
I rationed my cigarettes between cluttered meditations.
The rusty metal stairs that led to an office of foreign eyes was always counted one step at a
time.
“Don’t forget to breathe” I’d tell myself.
Quickly I’d forget.
The suffocation of regret blocked all attempts at making my first step towards anything that
resembled a picture of us.
You are nothing but a construct.
A social experiment that God left me ill-equipped to find success in.
Yesterday I will fight for you when tomorrow has already happened.
This ideology gave my procrastination layers.
The clouds slowly drift, crashing into one another.
When my guilt leaves, I hope it finds you.
And if it does, crack it with a hammer, and bury it somewhere in Anaheim.
