Cool water on her face amazing grace! Angels whisper her name. Blurring visions yet beginning to see. There were two dusty roads ahead of her. From the distance ahead of her she saw a man walking. As he got closer she realized it was her father. He had wings, and he was young again. Confused she didn't understand her father had died in the early 1990's. He told her he's taking her to a new life, and that her earthly life was over. They both continued to walk down toward the end of the road he had chosen. At the end of the road they both stepped into another dimension. When she entered the new dimension she became young again. She smiled and hugged her father with joy. The farther they walked everything became so beautiful. Angels were all around them in bands. People who once lived had wings much like the angels. The angels welcomed all of the newcomers who had arrived. One angel walked up to her touching her shoulders. With a flapping sound her wings appeared! When they flew it was so bright, and unlike human form. Grabbing her hand they flew upward into a whirling tunnel into heaven! The End
