Like changing a tire or old days of pumping gas, learning passwords, geopolitical streets; connecting the cables, TV, sound bar, DVR; omnipresence of disease, germs, insurrection... what if something new comes along suggesting history or tradition, arias, road maps. Squares of faces screen talks back, and they ask you. What vocabulary has armed you? Have you prepared any response? What if there's no food in the house? What if you keep imagining there's no food in the house even though the refrigerator is full because you're always going shopping to get food, so you don't have to sit down in front of this machine with all its alphabets and figure out what you need to say. Perhaps. In modern life we need to have opinions, or just come up with anything; if you need a way to answer, confess to something else. Change the subject. Tell them whatever you know.
