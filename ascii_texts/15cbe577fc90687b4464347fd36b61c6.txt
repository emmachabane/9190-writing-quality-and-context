The door crashes into the days of buried disappointments if I'll ever get out of there out of here? or get in there? A window behind the backs in illusion of safety A strong wind plies them into surprise and unsettlement The steady and soft body of a child full of laughter and curiosity invites play There is no danger and no safety there I measure the time and the differences or is it a gap? from underneath my dress towards an infinite point in the space among those sitting in the raw who see a crazy fool with hair more normal than theirs and hands discomfortingly free Well, don't bother... you can close that door again and don't forget the window leave the day to me
