Camille read an article on ancient man. The topic was their diet and how they didn't have the variety that we have today. For example, they didn't have oats and corn, but they had domesticated animals such as cows and dogs, and yes, they ate the dogs. At this point, Camille says, "If you were a dog and your master killed you for food wouldn't you start to be really nice and loyal and build this wonderful dog-human relationship?" We laughed about this and how smart dogs were for coming up with this ploy to save their lives, when Camille said, "I guess cows didn't figure this out," then she paused and said, "But cows in India figured something similar out." We both laughed at this. Then Camille said this makes her look at Sandy (our dog) in a whole different light: manipulation to save your life, if you don't know any other way, it's as good a tool as any other. This conversation with Camille brought to mind my idea of cows I have had for a while. That is they are brainwashed. The fact that dairy cows always come home at night, and just the fact that they haven't figured out, like dogs, how to manipulate their masters in order to survive. Instead they are compliant and walk to their deaths without a fight. Not only do they walk to their deaths but dairy cows live a life of milked servitude living in sometimes unlivable conditions, but they don't do anything about it. They are brainwashed. They are in such fear of their masters that they are paralyzed, not just fear but they are compliant to their lifestyles. They feel they couldn't survive on their own so they beg up to their masters, coming home every night being hooked up to machines to be milked and going to sleep in a bed of mud; dependence, for food, to be milked, to survive. Instead of manipulating like the dogs they comply and are brainwashed into a life of servitude.
